  - Jackson Levine

Name of Project:

  - TBD

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

  - This will be an in-browser game using Three.js and React. Making use of a Firebase backend, users will be able to sign in with their Google account or other, and will join a massively multiplayer online world with a global chat.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

  - Users can securely log in/authenticate
  - Users can see each other and control their own character

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

  - Firebase
  - Three.js
  - React.js

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

  - Generating a voxel world for the users and allowing users to build on to to the world
  - Realistic physics in the world

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

  - Smooth noise algorithm, likely Perlin noise
  - Collision algorithm, likely Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)
